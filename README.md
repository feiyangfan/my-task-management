## Project: my daily planner
As the name suggested.

## Currently paused because of school work

This is a simple web daily planner app I am trying to make.  I was inspired to make this app because I feel like I need to use multiple apps just for planning out my days, which is a bit inefficient.  
I will be building frontend with react, backend with express, and connect the app to mongoDB datebase. Also try to deploy the website using a free host. I have no prior web development experiences and will be learning and recording useful things that I learned along the way.

**My goal is that every user has their own data stored in database, and can only be accessed when they log in with their google account.**


## Features

1. **Homepage**: The homepage will display current time, date, and weather at the top. Also several display cards that display information from todo list and timetable.
2. **Weather card**: The app will detect user's geolocation(given permission), and display current weather and date at user's location. The user can also search for weather at other cities. 
3. **Todo list**: The user can add, delete, name/rename a todo list, also add, delete, and edit an event from a todo list. They can create multiple todo lists and each of them has multiple todo event.
4. **Timetable**: A timetable that the user can add new events at different timeslots, edit added events, and delete unwanted events.

## How to use
Frontend is deployed on netlify, [link](https://ffy-my-daily-planner.netlify.app/), currently being working on so the link might not work  
Backend api is deployed on heroku, [link]( https://ffy-my-daily-planner-backend.herokuapp.com/), currently does not have a view engine, purely served as an api.



## What I learned

General:  
1. Never save API keys or secrets in frontend, it is best to save them as env variables in backend
2. Use devDependencies to seperate development packages and production packages
